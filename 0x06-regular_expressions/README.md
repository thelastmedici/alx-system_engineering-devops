# 0x06 Regular Expressions

This project is part of the ALX DevOps curriculum and focuses on regular expressions.

## Description

In this project, we will explore the concept of regular expressions and their applications in software development. Regular expressions are powerful tools for pattern matching and text manipulation. They can be used to search, validate, and extract specific patterns from strings.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the basics of regular expressions
- Use regular expressions to search for patterns in text
- Validate input using regular expressions
- Extract specific information from strings using regular expressions

## Requirements

To complete this project, you will need:

- A text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE)
- A programming language that supports regular expressions (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Ruby)
