# 0x0F. Load Balancer

This project is part of the ALX Higher Level Programming curriculum and focuses on load balancing in web development.

## Description

The goal of this project is to implement a simple HTTP load balancer using Nginx. The load balancer will distribute incoming requests across multiple backend servers to ensure optimal performance and high availability.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will learn:

- What a load balancer is and why it is used in web development
- The different load balancing algorithms and their advantages/disadvantages
- How to configure Nginx as a load balancer
- How to deploy and test a load balanced web application

## Requirements

To complete this project, you will need:

- A basic understanding of web development concepts (HTTP, servers, etc.)
- Familiarity with Linux and command line tools
- Access to a Linux machine or virtual environment
- Nginx installed on your machine

## Usage

To use the load balancer, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install Nginx if you haven't already.
3. Configure Nginx as a load balancer by modifying the Nginx configuration file.
4. Start Nginx and ensure it is running correctly.
5. Test the load balancer by sending HTTP requests to the configured IP address or domain name.
